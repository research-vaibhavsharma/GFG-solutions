    "## Problem Statement:\n",
    "Given a weighted tree with n nodes and (n-1) edges. You are given q queries. Each query contains a number x. For each query, find the number of paths in which the maximum edge weight is less than or equal to x.<br>\n",
    "Note: Path from A to B and B to A are considered to be the same.<br>\n",
    "Your Task:  <br>\n",
    "You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function maximumWeight()which takes integers n, list of edges where each edge is given by {start,end,weight}, an integer q and a list of q queries as input parameters and returns a list of integers denoting the number of possible paths for each query. <br>\n",
    "Expected Time Complexity: O(nlogn + qlogn)<br>\n",
    "Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach:\n",
    "1. Sort the `Edges` by their `weight` (ascending).\n",
    "2. Sort Queries by the value of `x`, keeping track of their original `indices`.\n",
    "3. Use `Union-Find (DSU)` to progressively build connected components:\n",
    "    * When you add an edge with `weight ≤ x`, any two nodes that get connected create new valid paths.\n",
    "    * For each union operation, if component `sizes` are `a` and `b`, `new paths = a * b`.\n",
    "4. For each query, count how many paths exist after inserting all edges with `weight ≤ x`.\n",
    "# Complexity:\n",
    "Sorting edges: $O(n \\log n)$<br>\n",
    "Sorting queries: $O(q \\log q)$<br>\n",
    "DSU operations: Amortized $O(\\alpha(n)) ≈ O(1)$ per operation<br>\n",
    "Total time: $O(n \\log n + q \\log q)$, which meets the expected complexity.\n",
