    "## Problem Statement:\n",
    "Elena is the topper of the class. Once her teacher asked her a problem. He gave Elena an array of integers of length n. He calls a subset of array arr good if its product can be represented as a product of one or more distinct prime numbers. He asked her to find the number of different good subsets in arr modulo 109 + 7. Your Task:\n",
    "The task is to complete the function goodSubsets() which takes an integer n and an array arr as the input parameters and should return the number of different good subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach:\n",
    "1. Constraints on Valid Numbers\n",
    "From problem context, we assume that array elements are in a reasonable range (usually 1 <= arr[i] <= 30 in similar problems). This allows us to precompute:\n",
    "    * Which numbers from 2 to 30 are square-free.\n",
    "    * Their prime masks — representing which prime numbers divide them.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Preprocessing\n",
    "    * Define all primes up to 30: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29].\n",
    "    * For each number x from 2 to 30:\n",
    "        * If it is divisible by a square number (like 4, 9, 25), discard it.\n",
    "        * Else compute its prime mask: a bitmask representing which primes divide it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Count Frequencies\n",
    "* Count how many times each number appears in arr.\n",
    "* Specifically, count how many times 1 appears (special case, explained later).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Dynamic Programming (DP) Over Masks\n",
    "    * Use a dictionary dp where keys are masks (integers) representing product of distinct primes, and values are counts of subsets forming that product.\n",
    "    * Initialize dp[0] = 1, representing the empty subset.\n",
    "    * Then for each valid number x in the array:\n",
    "        * For each existing mask m in dp, if x’s prime mask doesn’t conflict with m (i.e., (m & x_mask) == 0), create a new mask m | x_mask and update its count accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Final Count\n",
    "    * Sum all dp[mask] for mask != 0, as mask = 0 is the empty set (not a valid good subset).\n",
    "    * Multiply the final count by 2^count[1], because each subset can optionally include or exclude any number of 1s (which don’t affect the product).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Modulo\n",
    " * Return the result modulo 10^9 + 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time Complexity:\n",
    "$O(n+\\log n)$"
